 \begin{DoxyParagraph}{Purpose\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb} CHETRF computes the factorization of a complex Hermitian matrix A
 using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method.  The form of the
 factorization is

    A = U*D*U**H  or  A = L*D*L**H

 where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
 triangular matrices, and D is Hermitian and block diagonal with 
 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

 This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.\end{DoxyVerb}

          On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
          N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
          leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
          triangular part of A is not referenced.

          On exit, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
          to obtain the factor U or L (see below for further details).\end{DoxyVerb}

          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.
          If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
          interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
          If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and
          columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
          is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =
          IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
          interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.\end{DoxyVerb}

          > 0:  if INFO = i, D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
                exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if it
                is used to solve a system of equations.\end{DoxyVerb}

\begin{DoxyVerb}  If UPLO = 'U', then A = U*D*U**H, where
     U = P(n)*U(n)* ... *P(k)U(k)* ...,
  i.e., U is a product of terms P(k)*U(k), where k decreases from n to
  1 in steps of 1 or 2, and D is a block diagonal matrix with 1-by-1
  and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks D(k).  P(k) is a permutation matrix as
  defined by IPIV(k), and U(k) is a unit upper triangular matrix, such
  that if the diagonal block D(k) is of order s (s = 1 or 2), then

             (   I    v    0   )   k-s

             (   0    0    I   )   n-k
                k-s   s   n-k

  If s = 1, D(k) overwrites A(k,k), and v overwrites A(1:k-1,k).
  If s = 2, the upper triangle of D(k) overwrites A(k-1,k-1), A(k-1,k),
  and A(k,k), and v overwrites A(1:k-2,k-1:k).

  If UPLO = 'L', then A = L*D*L**H, where
     L = P(1)*L(1)* ... *P(k)*L(k)* ...,
  i.e., L is a product of terms P(k)*L(k), where k increases from 1 to
  n in steps of 1 or 2, and D is a block diagonal matrix with 1-by-1
  and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks D(k).  P(k) is a permutation matrix as
  defined by IPIV(k), and L(k) is a unit lower triangular matrix, such
  that if the diagonal block D(k) is of order s (s = 1 or 2), then

             (   I    0     0   )  k-1

                k-1   s  n-k-s+1

  If s = 1, D(k) overwrites A(k,k), and v overwrites A(k+1:n,k).
  If s = 2, the lower triangle of D(k) overwrites A(k,k), A(k+1,k),
  and A(k+1,k+1), and v overwrites A(k+2:n,k:k+1).\end{DoxyVerb}
