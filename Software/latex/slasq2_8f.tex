{\bfseries S\+L\+A\+S\+Q2} computes all the eigenvalues of the symmetric positive definite tridiagonal matrix associated with the qd \hyperlink{classArray}{Array} Z to high relative accuracy. Used by sbdsqr and sstegr. 

 \begin{DoxyParagraph}{Purpose\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb} SLASQ2 computes all the eigenvalues of the symmetric positive 
 definite tridiagonal matrix associated with the qd array Z to high
 relative accuracy are computed to high relative accuracy, in the
 absence of denormalization, underflow and overflow.

 To see the relation of Z to the tridiagonal matrix, let L be a
 unit lower bidiagonal matrix with subdiagonals Z(2,4,6,,..) and
 let U be an upper bidiagonal matrix with 1's above and diagonal
 Z(1,3,5,,..). The tridiagonal is L*U or, if you prefer, the
 symmetric tridiagonal to which it is similar.

 Note : SLASQ2 defines a logical variable, IEEE, which is true
 on machines which follow ieee-754 floating-point standard in their
 handling of infinities and NaNs, and false otherwise. This variable
 is passed to SLASQ3.\end{DoxyVerb}

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em N} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          N is INTEGER
        The number of rows and columns in the matrix. N >= 0.\end{DoxyVerb}

\mbox{\tt in,out}  & {\em Z} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          Z is REAL array, dimension ( 4*N )
        On entry Z holds the qd array. On exit, entries 1 to N hold
        the eigenvalues in decreasing order, Z( 2*N+1 ) holds the
        trace, and Z( 2*N+2 ) holds the sum of the eigenvalues. If
        N > 2, then Z( 2*N+3 ) holds the iteration count, Z( 2*N+4 )
        holds NDIVS/NIN^2, and Z( 2*N+5 ) holds the percentage of
        shifts that failed.\end{DoxyVerb}

                   a qd array with the same eigenvalues as the given Z.

\begin{DoxyVerb}  Local Variables: I0:N0 defines a current unreduced segment of Z.
  The shifts are accumulated in SIGMA. Iteration count is in ITER.
