 \begin{DoxyParagraph}{Purpose\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb}    CHERFSX improves the computed solution to a system of linear
    equations when the coefficient matrix is Hermitian indefinite, and
    provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the
    solution.  In addition to normwise error bound, the code provides
    maximum componentwise error bound if possible.  See comments for
    ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the error bounds.

    The original system of linear equations may have been equilibrated
    before calling this routine, as described by arguments EQUED and S
    below. In this case, the solution and error bounds returned are
    for the original unequilibrated system.\end{DoxyVerb}
 \begin{DoxyVerb}     Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
     settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
     defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
     can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
     the PARAMS argument.\end{DoxyVerb}

\end{DoxyParagraph}

       = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em E\+Q\+U\+E\+D} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          EQUED is CHARACTER*1
     Specifies the form of equilibration that was done to A
     before calling this routine. This is needed to compute
     the solution and error bounds correctly.
       = 'N':  No equilibration
       = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
               replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
               The right hand side B has been changed accordingly.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em N} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          N is INTEGER
     The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em N\+R\+H\+S} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          NRHS is INTEGER
     The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
     of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em \hyperlink{classA}{A}} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
     The symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
     upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular
     part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular
     part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading
     N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
     triangular part of A is not referenced.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em L\+D\+A} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          LDA is INTEGER

\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em A\+F} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          AF is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAF,N)
     The factored form of the matrix A.  AF contains the block
     diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to obtain the
     factor U or L from the factorization A = U*D*U**T or A =
     L*D*L**T as computed by SSYTRF.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em L\+D\+A\+F} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          LDAF is INTEGER

     Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
     as determined by SSYTRF.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in,out}  & {\em S} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          S is REAL array, dimension (N)
     The scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
     the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
     'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
     = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
     element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
     of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
     and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
     rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
     Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
     is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
     that may not be reliable.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em B} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          B is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
     The right hand side matrix B.\end{DoxyVerb}

     On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by SGETRS.

     The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em R\+C\+O\+N\+D} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          RCOND is REAL
     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
     conditioned.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\

\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em B\+E\+R\+R} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
     Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
     componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
     (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
     makes X(j) an exact solution).\end{DoxyVerb}

     Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
     and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
     ERR_BNDS_COMP below.\end{DoxyVerb}

     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
             max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
            ------------------------------
                  max_j abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
     returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

     cautions.\end{DoxyVerb}

     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                    abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
             max_j ----------------------
                         abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
     information as described below. There currently are up to three
     pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS .LT. 3, then at most
     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold

              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
              current right-hand side and S scales each row of
              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
              sums of Z are approximately 1.
