{\bfseries  D\+P\+P\+S\+V\+X computes the solution to system of linear equations \hyperlink{classA}{A} $\ast$ X = B for O\+T\+H\+E\+R matrices} 

 \begin{DoxyParagraph}{Purpose\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb} DPPSVX uses the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T to
 compute the solution to a real system of linear equations
    A * X = B,
 where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite matrix stored in
 packed format and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

 Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
 provided.\end{DoxyVerb}
 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Description\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb} The following steps are performed:

 1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
    the system:
       diag(S) * A * diag(S) * inv(diag(S)) * X = diag(S) * B
    Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
    scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
    overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

 2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the Cholesky decomposition is used to
    factor the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
       A = U**T* U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
       A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
    where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular
    matrix.

 3. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
    then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
    form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
    A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine
    precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine
    still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as
    described below.

 4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
    of A.

 5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
    matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
    for it.

 6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
    diag(S) so that it solves the original system before
    equilibration.\end{DoxyVerb}

          Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
          supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
          equilibrated before it is factored.

                  If EQUED = 'Y', the matrix A has been equilibrated
                  with scaling factors given by S.  AP and AFP will not
                  be modified.
          = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AFP and factored.
          = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
                  copied to AFP and factored.\end{DoxyVerb}

          diag(S)*A*diag(S).  The j-th column of A is stored in the

          factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, in the same storage
          format as A.  If EQUED .ne. 'N', then AFP is the factored
          form of the equilibrated matrix A.

          returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
          factorization A = U**T * U or A = L * L**T of the original
          matrix A.

          factorization A = U**T * U or A = L * L**T of the equilibrated
          matrix A (see the description of AP for the form of the

          = 'Y':  Equilibration was done, i.e., A has been replaced by
                  diag(S) * A * diag(S).
          EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an

\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in,out}  & {\em S} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          S is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
          The scale factors for A; not accessed if EQUED = 'N'.  S is
          an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, S is an output
          argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED = 'Y', each element of S
          must be positive.\end{DoxyVerb}

          On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.

          the original system of equations.  Note that if EQUED = 'Y',

          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
          A after equilibration (if done).  If RCOND is less than the
          machine precision (in particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix
          is singular to working precision.  This condition is
          indicated by a return code of INFO > 0.\end{DoxyVerb}

\hline
\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em F\+E\+R\+R} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          FERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
          overestimate of the true error.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em B\+E\+R\+R} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).\end{DoxyVerb}

\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em I\+W\+O\+R\+K} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N)\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em I\+N\+F\+O} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          INFO is INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
                <= N:  the leading minor of order i of A is
                       not positive definite, so the factorization
                       could not be completed, and the solution has not
                       been computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                       solution and error bounds are computed because
                       there are a number of situations where the
                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
                       value of RCOND would suggest.\end{DoxyVerb}
