{\bfseries  Z\+H\+E\+S\+V\+X\+X computes the solution to system of linear equations \hyperlink{classA}{A} $\ast$ X = B for H\+E matrices} 

 \begin{DoxyParagraph}{Purpose\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb}    ZHESVXX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization to compute the
    solution to a complex*16 system of linear equations A * X = B, where
    A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
    matrices.

    If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
    are returned. ZHESVXX will return a solution with a tiny
    guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
    precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
    case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
    calculated and returned.

    ZHESVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
    factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
    Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
    ZHESVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
    errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
    user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
    differ from what ZHESVXX would itself produce.\end{DoxyVerb}
 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Description\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb}    The following steps are performed:

    1. If FACT = 'E', double precision scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
    the system:

      diag(S)*A*diag(S)     *inv(diag(S))*X = diag(S)*B

    Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
    scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
    overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

    2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor
    the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as

       A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
       A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',

    where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
    triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
    1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

    3. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the
    routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A
    is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A (see
    argument RCOND).  If the reciprocal of the condition number is
    less than machine precision, the routine still goes on to solve
    for X and compute error bounds as described below.

    4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
    of A.

    5. By default (unless PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I) is set to zero),
    the routine will use iterative refinement to try to get a small
    error and error bounds.  Refinement calculates the residual to at
    least twice the working precision.

    6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
    diag(R) so that it solves the original system before
    equilibration.\end{DoxyVerb}
 \begin{DoxyVerb}     Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
     settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
     defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
     can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
     the PARAMS argument.\end{DoxyVerb}

\end{DoxyParagraph}

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}

     The symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
     upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular
     part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular
     part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading

\mbox{\tt in,out}  & {\em A\+F} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          AF is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAF,N)
     If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry
     contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
     used to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization A =
     U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T as computed by DSYTRF.

     If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
     returns the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
     used to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization A =
     U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T.\end{DoxyVerb}

     If FACT = 'F', then IPIV is an input argument and on entry
     contains details of the interchanges and the block
     structure of D, as determined by ZHETRF.  If IPIV(k) > 0,
     then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were interchanged and
     D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'U' and
     IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and columns k-1 and
     -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2
     diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) < 0,
     then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged
     and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

     If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit

     structure of D, as determined by ZHETRF.\end{DoxyVerb}

\hline
\mbox{\tt in,out}  & {\em E\+Q\+U\+E\+D} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          EQUED is CHARACTER*1
     Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
       = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
       = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
               replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
     EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
     output argument.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in,out}  & {\em S} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          S is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
     The scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
     the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
     'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
     = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
     element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
     of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
     and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
     rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
     Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
     is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
     that may not be reliable.\end{DoxyVerb}

\mbox{\tt in,out}  & {\em B} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          B is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)

     If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X to the original
     system of equations.  Note that A and B are modified on exit if
     EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the equilibrated system is
     inv(diag(S))*X.\end{DoxyVerb}

\hline
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em L\+D\+X} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          LDX is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em R\+C\+O\+N\+D} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
     conditioned.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em R\+P\+V\+G\+R\+W} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          RPVGRW is DOUBLE PRECISION
     Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
     pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element"
     norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
     the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
     This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
     and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
     0<INFO<=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
     for the leading INFO columns of A.\end{DoxyVerb}

\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em B\+E\+R\+R} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
     Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
     componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
     (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
     makes X(j) an exact solution).\end{DoxyVerb}

     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about

            ------------------------------

     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
     returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith

              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some

            refinement or not.
         Default: 1.0D+0
            = 0.0 : No refinement is performed, and no error bounds are
                    computed.
            = 1.0 : Use the extra-precise refinement algorithm.
              (other values are reserved for future use)

       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITHRESH_I = 2) : Maximum number of residual
            computations allowed for refinement.
         Default: 10
         Aggressive: Set to 100 to permit convergence using approximate
                     factorizations or factorizations other than LU. If
                     the factorization uses a technique other than
                     Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
                     err_bnds_norm and err_bnds_comp may no longer be
                     trustworthy.

       PARAMS(LA_LINRX_CWISE_I = 3) : Flag determining if the code
            will attempt to find a solution with small componentwise
            relative error in the double-precision algorithm.  Positive
            is true, 0.0 is false.
         Default: 1.0 (attempt componentwise convergence)\end{DoxyVerb}

       = 0:  Successful exit. The solution to every right-hand side is
         guaranteed.
       < 0:  If INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
       > 0 and <= N:  U(INFO,INFO) is exactly zero.  The factorization
         has been completed, but the factor U is exactly singular, so
         the solution and error bounds could not be computed. RCOND = 0
         is returned.
       = N+J: The solution corresponding to the Jth right-hand side is
         not guaranteed. The solutions corresponding to other right-
         hand sides K with K > J may not be guaranteed as well, but
         only the first such right-hand side is reported. If a small
         componentwise error is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0) then
         the Jth right-hand side is the first with a normwise error
         bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest J such
         that ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0). By default (PARAMS(3) = 1.0)
         the Jth right-hand side is the first with either a normwise or
         componentwise error bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest
         J such that either ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0 or
         ERR_BNDS_COMP(J,1) = 0.0). See the definition of
         ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,1) and ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,1). To get information
         about all of the right-hand sides check ERR_BNDS_NORM or
         ERR_BNDS_COMP.\end{DoxyVerb}
