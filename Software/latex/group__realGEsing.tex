 \begin{DoxyParagraph}{Purpose\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb} SGEJSV computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real M-by-N
 matrix [A], where M >= N. The SVD of [A] is written as

              [A] = [U] * [SIGMA] * [V]^t,

 where [SIGMA] is an N-by-N (M-by-N) matrix which is zero except for its N
 diagonal elements, [U] is an M-by-N (or M-by-M) orthonormal matrix, and
 [V] is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix. The diagonal elements of [SIGMA] are
 the singular values of [A]. The columns of [U] and [V] are the left and
 the right singular vectors of [A], respectively. The matrices [U] and [V]
 are computed and stored in the arrays U and V, respectively. The diagonal
 of [SIGMA] is computed and stored in the array SVA.\end{DoxyVerb}
 
\end{DoxyParagraph}

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em J\+O\+B\+A} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          JOBA is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the level of accuracy:
       = 'C': This option works well (high relative accuracy) if A = B * D,
              with well-conditioned B and arbitrary diagonal matrix D.
              The accuracy cannot be spoiled by COLUMN scaling. The
              accuracy of the computed output depends on the condition of
              B, and the procedure aims at the best theoretical accuracy.
              The relative error max_{i=1:N}|d sigma_i| / sigma_i is
              bounded by f(M,N)*epsilon* cond(B), independent of D.
              The input matrix is preprocessed with the QRF with column
              pivoting. This initial preprocessing and preconditioning by
              a rank revealing QR factorization is common for all values of
              JOBA. Additional actions are specified as follows:
       = 'E': Computation as with 'C' with an additional estimate of the
              condition number of B. It provides a realistic error bound.
       = 'F': If A = D1 * C * D2 with ill-conditioned diagonal scalings
              D1, D2, and well-conditioned matrix C, this option gives
              higher accuracy than the 'C' option. If the structure of the
              input matrix is not known, and relative accuracy is
              desirable, then this option is advisable. The input matrix A
              is preprocessed with QR factorization with FULL (row and
              column) pivoting.
       = 'G'  Computation as with 'F' with an additional estimate of the
              condition number of B, where A=D*B. If A has heavily weighted
              rows, then using this condition number gives too pessimistic
              error bound.
       = 'A': Small singular values are the noise and the matrix is treated
              as numerically rank defficient. The error in the computed
              singular values is bounded by f(m,n)*epsilon*||A||.
              The computed SVD A = U * S * V^t restores A up to
              f(m,n)*epsilon*||A||.
              This gives the procedure the licence to discard (set to zero)
              all singular values below N*epsilon*||A||.
       = 'R': Similar as in 'A'. Rank revealing property of the initial
              QR factorization is used do reveal (using triangular factor)
              a gap sigma_{r+1} < epsilon * sigma_r in which case the
              numerical RANK is declared to be r. The SVD is computed with
              absolute error bounds, but more accurately than with 'A'.\end{DoxyVerb}

\hline
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em J\+O\+B\+U} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          JOBU is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether to compute the columns of U:
       = 'U': N columns of U are returned in the array U.
       = 'F': full set of M left sing. vectors is returned in the array U.
       = 'W': U may be used as workspace of length M*N. See the description
              of U.
       = 'N': U is not computed.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em J\+O\+B\+V} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          JOBV is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies whether to compute the matrix V:
       = 'V': N columns of V are returned in the array V; Jacobi rotations
              are not explicitly accumulated.
       = 'J': N columns of V are returned in the array V, but they are
              computed as the product of Jacobi rotations. This option is
              allowed only if JOBU .NE. 'N', i.e. in computing the full SVD.
       = 'W': V may be used as workspace of length N*N. See the description
              of V.
       = 'N': V is not computed.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em J\+O\+B\+R} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          JOBR is CHARACTER*1
         Specifies the RANGE for the singular values. Issues the licence to
         set to zero small positive singular values if they are outside
         specified range. If A .NE. 0 is scaled so that the largest singular
         value of c*A is around SQRT(BIG), BIG=SLAMCH('O'), then JOBR issues
         the licence to kill columns of A whose norm in c*A is less than
         SQRT(SFMIN) (for JOBR.EQ.'R'), or less than SMALL=SFMIN/EPSLN,
         where SFMIN=SLAMCH('S'), EPSLN=SLAMCH('E').
       = 'N': Do not kill small columns of c*A. This option assumes that
              BLAS and QR factorizations and triangular solvers are
              implemented to work in that range. If the condition of A
              is greater than BIG, use SGESVJ.
       = 'R': RESTRICTED range for sigma(c*A) is [SQRT(SFMIN), SQRT(BIG)]
              (roughly, as described above). This option is recommended.
                                             ===========================
         For computing the singular values in the FULL range [SFMIN,BIG]
         use SGESVJ.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em J\+O\+B\+T} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          JOBT is CHARACTER*1
         If the matrix is square then the procedure may determine to use
         transposed A if A^t seems to be better with respect to convergence.
         If the matrix is not square, JOBT is ignored. This is subject to
         changes in the future.
         The decision is based on two values of entropy over the adjoint
         orbit of A^t * A. See the descriptions of WORK(6) and WORK(7).
       = 'T': transpose if entropy test indicates possibly faster
         convergence of Jacobi process if A^t is taken as input. If A is
         replaced with A^t, then the row pivoting is included automatically.
       = 'N': do not speculate.
         This option can be used to compute only the singular values, or the
         full SVD (U, SIGMA and V). For only one set of singular vectors
         (U or V), the caller should provide both U and V, as one of the
         matrices is used as workspace if the matrix A is transposed.
         The implementer can easily remove this constraint and make the
         code more complicated. See the descriptions of U and V.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em J\+O\+B\+P} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          JOBP is CHARACTER*1
         Issues the licence to introduce structured perturbations to drown
         denormalized numbers. This licence should be active if the
         denormals are poorly implemented, causing slow computation,
         especially in cases of fast convergence (!). For details see [1,2].
         For the sake of simplicity, this perturbations are included only
         when the full SVD or only the singular values are requested. The
         implementer/user can easily add the perturbation for the cases of
         computing one set of singular vectors.
       = 'P': introduce perturbation
       = 'N': do not perturb\end{DoxyVerb}

            sigma_max(A) overflows or if small singular values have been
            saved from underflow by scaling the input matrix A.
          - If JOBR='R' then some of the singular values may be returned

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Further Details\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb}  SGEJSV implements a preconditioned Jacobi SVD algorithm. It uses SGEQP3,
  SGEQRF, and SGELQF as preprocessors and preconditioners. Optionally, an
  additional row pivoting can be used as a preprocessor, which in some
  cases results in much higher accuracy. An example is matrix A with the
  structure A = D1 * C * D2, where D1, D2 are arbitrarily ill-conditioned
  diagonal matrices and C is well-conditioned matrix. In that case, complete
  pivoting in the first QR factorizations provides accuracy dependent on the
  condition number of C, and independent of D1, D2. Such higher accuracy is
  not completely understood theoretically, but it works well in practice.
  Further, if A can be written as A = B*D, with well-conditioned B and some
  diagonal D, then the high accuracy is guaranteed, both theoretically and
  in software, independent of D. For more details see [1], [2].
     The computational range for the singular values can be the full range
  ( UNDERFLOW,OVERFLOW ), provided that the machine arithmetic and the BLAS
  & LAPACK routines called by SGEJSV are implemented to work in that range.
  If that is not the case, then the restriction for safe computation with
  the singular values in the range of normalized IEEE numbers is that the
  spectral condition number kappa(A)=sigma_max(A)/sigma_min(A) does not
  overflow. This code (SGEJSV) is best used in this restricted range,
  meaning that singular values of magnitude below ||A||_2 / SLAMCH('O') are
  returned as zeros. See JOBR for details on this.
     Further, this implementation is somewhat slower than the one described
  in [1,2] due to replacement of some non-LAPACK components, and because
  the choice of some tuning parameters in the iterative part (SGESVJ) is
  left to the implementer on a particular machine.
     The rank revealing QR factorization (in this code: SGEQP3) should be
  implemented as in [3]. We have a new version of SGEQP3 under development
  that is more robust than the current one in LAPACK, with a cleaner cut in
  rank defficient cases. It will be available in the SIGMA library [4].
  If M is much larger than N, it is obvious that the inital QRF with
  column pivoting can be preprocessed by the QRF without pivoting. That
  well known trick is not used in SGEJSV because in some cases heavy row
  weighting can be treated with complete pivoting. The overhead in cases
  M much larger than N is then only due to pivoting, but the benefits in
  terms of accuracy have prevailed. The implementer/user can incorporate
  this extra QRF step easily. The implementer can also improve data movement
  (matrix transpose, matrix copy, matrix transposed copy) - this
  implementation of SGEJSV uses only the simplest, naive data movement.\end{DoxyVerb}

 \begin{DoxyParagraph}{Purpose\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb} SGESDD computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real
 M-by-N matrix A, optionally computing the left and right singular
 vectors.  If singular vectors are desired, it uses a
 divide-and-conquer algorithm.

 The SVD is written

      A = U * SIGMA * transpose(V)

 where SIGMA is an M-by-N matrix which is zero except for its
 min(m,n) diagonal elements, U is an M-by-M orthogonal matrix, and
 V is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix.  The diagonal elements of SIGMA
 are the singular values of A; they are real and non-negative, and
 are returned in descending order.  The first min(m,n) columns of
 U and V are the left and right singular vectors of A.

 Note that the routine returns VT = V**T, not V.

 The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
 floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
 digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
 digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
 Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
 without guard digits, but we know of none.\end{DoxyVerb}

\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em L\+W\+O\+R\+K} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          LWORK is INTEGER
          The dimension of the array WORK.
          LWORK >= MAX(1,5*MIN(M,N)) for the paths (see comments inside code):
             - PATH 1  (M much larger than N, JOBU='N') 
             - PATH 1t (N much larger than M, JOBVT='N')
          LWORK >= MAX(1,3*MIN(M,N)+MAX(M,N),5*MIN(M,N)) for the other paths
          For good performance, LWORK should generally be larger.

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.\end{DoxyVerb}

          > 0:  if SBDSQR did not converge, INFO specifies how many
                superdiagonals of an intermediate bidiagonal form B
                did not converge to zero. See the description of WORK
