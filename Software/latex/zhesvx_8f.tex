{\bfseries  Z\+H\+E\+S\+V\+X computes the solution to system of linear equations \hyperlink{classA}{A} $\ast$ X = B for H\+E matrices} 

 \begin{DoxyParagraph}{Purpose\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb} ZHESVX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization to compute the
 solution to a complex system of linear equations A * X = B,
 where A is an N-by-N Hermitian matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
 matrices.

 Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
 provided.\end{DoxyVerb}
 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Description\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb} The following steps are performed:

 1. If FACT = 'N', the diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A.
    The form of the factorization is
       A = U * D * U**H,  if UPLO = 'U', or
       A = L * D * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L',
    where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
    triangular matrices, and D is Hermitian and block diagonal with
    1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

 2. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the routine
    returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
    to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
    reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
    INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
    to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.

 3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
    of A.

 4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
    matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
    for it.\end{DoxyVerb}

          contains details of the interchanges and the block structure
          of D, as determined by ZHETRF.
          If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
          interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
          If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and
          columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
          is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =
          IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
          interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

          The N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.\end{DoxyVerb}

\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em R\+C\+O\+N\+D} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
          A.  If RCOND is less than the machine precision (in
          particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix is singular to working
          precision.  This condition is indicated by a return code of
          INFO > 0.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em F\+E\+R\+R} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          FERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
          overestimate of the true error.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em B\+E\+R\+R} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em W\+O\+R\+K} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in}  & {\em L\+W\+O\+R\+K} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          LWORK is INTEGER
          The length of WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,2*N), and for best
          performance, when FACT = 'N', LWORK >= max(1,2*N,N*NB), where
          NB is the optimal blocksize for ZHETRF.

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em R\+W\+O\+R\+K} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em I\+N\+F\+O} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          INFO is INTEGER
          = 0: successful exit
          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0: if INFO = i, and i is
                <= N:  D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                       has been completed but the factor D is exactly
                       singular, so the solution and error bounds could
                       not be computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
                = N+1: D is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                       solution and error bounds are computed because
                       there are a number of situations where the
                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
                       value of RCOND would suggest.\end{DoxyVerb}
