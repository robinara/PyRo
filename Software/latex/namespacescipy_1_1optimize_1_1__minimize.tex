\begin{DoxyVerb}Minimization of scalar function of one or more variables.

.. versionadded:: 0.11.0

Parameters
----------
fun : callable
    Objective function.
x0 : ndarray
    Initial guess.
args : tuple, optional
    Extra arguments passed to the objective function and its
    derivatives (Jacobian, Hessian).
method : str or callable, optional
    Type of solver.  Should be one of

        - 'Nelder-Mead'
        - 'Powell'
        - 'CG'
        - 'BFGS'
        - 'Newton-CG'
        - 'Anneal (deprecated as of scipy version 0.14.0)'
        - 'L-BFGS-B'
        - 'TNC'
        - 'COBYLA'
        - 'SLSQP'
        - 'dogleg'
        - 'trust-ncg'
        - custom - a callable object (added in version 0.14.0)

    If not given, chosen to be one of ``BFGS``, ``L-BFGS-B``, ``SLSQP``,
    depending if the problem has constraints or bounds.
jac : bool or callable, optional
    Jacobian (gradient) of objective function. Only for CG, BFGS,
    Newton-CG, L-BFGS-B, TNC, SLSQP, dogleg, trust-ncg.
    If `jac` is a Boolean and is True, `fun` is assumed to return the
    gradient along with the objective function. If False, the
    gradient will be estimated numerically.
    `jac` can also be a callable returning the gradient of the
    objective. In this case, it must accept the same arguments as `fun`.
hess, hessp : callable, optional
    Hessian (matrix of second-order derivatives) of objective function or
    Hessian of objective function times an arbitrary vector p.  Only for
    Newton-CG, dogleg, trust-ncg.
    Only one of `hessp` or `hess` needs to be given.  If `hess` is
    provided, then `hessp` will be ignored.  If neither `hess` nor
    `hessp` is provided, then the Hessian product will be approximated
    using finite differences on `jac`. `hessp` must compute the Hessian
    times an arbitrary vector.
bounds : sequence, optional
    Bounds for variables (only for L-BFGS-B, TNC and SLSQP).
    ``(min, max)`` pairs for each element in ``x``, defining
    the bounds on that parameter. Use None for one of ``min`` or
    ``max`` when there is no bound in that direction.
constraints : dict or sequence of dict, optional
    Constraints definition (only for COBYLA and SLSQP).
    Each constraint is defined in a dictionary with fields:
        type : str
            Constraint type: 'eq' for equality, 'ineq' for inequality.
        fun : callable
            The function defining the constraint.
        jac : callable, optional
            The Jacobian of `fun` (only for SLSQP).
        args : sequence, optional
            Extra arguments to be passed to the function and Jacobian.
    Equality constraint means that the constraint function result is to
    be zero whereas inequality means that it is to be non-negative.
    Note that COBYLA only supports inequality constraints.
tol : float, optional
    Tolerance for termination. For detailed control, use solver-specific
    options.
options : dict, optional
    A dictionary of solver options. All methods accept the following
    generic options:
        maxiter : int
            Maximum number of iterations to perform.
        disp : bool
            Set to True to print convergence messages.
    For method-specific options, see :func:`show_options()`.
callback : callable, optional
    Called after each iteration, as ``callback(xk)``, where ``xk`` is the
    current parameter vector.

Returns
-------
res : OptimizeResult
    The optimization result represented as a ``OptimizeResult`` object.
    Important attributes are: ``x`` the solution array, ``success`` a
    Boolean flag indicating if the optimizer exited successfully and
    ``message`` which describes the cause of the termination. See
    `OptimizeResult` for a description of other attributes.

Notes
-----
This section describes the available solvers that can be selected by the
'method' parameter. The default method is *BFGS*.

**Unconstrained minimization**

Method *Nelder-Mead* uses the Simplex algorithm [1]_, [2]_. This
algorithm has been successful in many applications but other algorithms
using the first and/or second derivatives information might be preferred
for their better performances and robustness in general.

Method *Powell* is a modification of Powell's method [3]_, [4]_ which
is a conjugate direction method. It performs sequential one-dimensional
minimizations along each vector of the directions set (`direc` field in
`options` and `info`), which is updated at each iteration of the main
minimization loop. The function need not be differentiable, and no
derivatives are taken.

Method *CG* uses a nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm by Polak and
Ribiere, a variant of the Fletcher-Reeves method described in [5]_ pp.
120-122. Only the first derivatives are used.

Method *BFGS* uses the quasi-Newton method of Broyden, Fletcher,
Goldfarb, and Shanno (BFGS) [5]_ pp. 136. It uses the first derivatives
only. BFGS has proven good performance even for non-smooth
optimizations. This method also returns an approximation of the Hessian
inverse, stored as `hess_inv` in the OptimizeResult object.

Method *Newton-CG* uses a Newton-CG algorithm [5]_ pp. 168 (also known
as the truncated Newton method). It uses a CG method to the compute the
search direction. See also *TNC* method for a box-constrained
minimization with a similar algorithm.

Method *Anneal* uses simulated annealing, which is a probabilistic
metaheuristic algorithm for global optimization. It uses no derivative
information from the function being optimized.

Method *dogleg* uses the dog-leg trust-region algorithm [5]_
for unconstrained minimization. This algorithm requires the gradient
and Hessian; furthermore the Hessian is required to be positive definite.

Method *trust-ncg* uses the Newton conjugate gradient trust-region
algorithm [5]_ for unconstrained minimization. This algorithm requires
the gradient and either the Hessian or a function that computes the
product of the Hessian with a given vector.

**Constrained minimization**

Method *L-BFGS-B* uses the L-BFGS-B algorithm [6]_, [7]_ for bound
constrained minimization.

Method *TNC* uses a truncated Newton algorithm [5]_, [8]_ to minimize a
function with variables subject to bounds. This algorithm uses
gradient information; it is also called Newton Conjugate-Gradient. It
differs from the *Newton-CG* method described above as it wraps a C
implementation and allows each variable to be given upper and lower
bounds.

Method *COBYLA* uses the Constrained Optimization BY Linear
Approximation (COBYLA) method [9]_, [10]_, [11]_. The algorithm is
based on linear approximations to the objective function and each
constraint. The method wraps a FORTRAN implementation of the algorithm.

Method *SLSQP* uses Sequential Least SQuares Programming to minimize a
function of several variables with any combination of bounds, equality
and inequality constraints. The method wraps the SLSQP Optimization
subroutine originally implemented by Dieter Kraft [12]_. Note that the
wrapper handles infinite values in bounds by converting them into large
floating values.

**Custom minimizers**

It may be useful to pass a custom minimization method, for example
when using a frontend to this method such as `scipy.optimize.basinhopping`
or a different library.  You can simply pass a callable as the ``method``
parameter.

The callable is called as ``method(fun, x0, args, **kwargs, **options)``
where ``kwargs`` corresponds to any other parameters passed to `minimize`
(such as `callback`, `hess`, etc.), except the `options` dict, which has
its contents also passed as `method` parameters pair by pair.  Also, if
`jac` has been passed as a bool type, `jac` and `fun` are mangled so that
`fun` returns just the function values and `jac` is converted to a function
returning the Jacobian.  The method shall return an ``OptimizeResult``
object.

The provided `method` callable must be able to accept (and possibly ignore)
arbitrary parameters; the set of parameters accepted by `minimize` may
expand in future versions and then these parameters will be passed to
the method.  You can find an example in the scipy.optimize tutorial.

Examples
--------
Let us consider the problem of minimizing the Rosenbrock function. This
function (and its respective derivatives) is implemented in `rosen`
(resp. `rosen_der`, `rosen_hess`) in the `scipy.optimize`.

>>> from scipy.optimize import minimize, rosen, rosen_der

A simple application of the *Nelder-Mead* method is:

>>> x0 = [1.3, 0.7, 0.8, 1.9, 1.2]
>>> res = minimize(rosen, x0, method='Nelder-Mead')
>>> res.x
[ 1.  1.  1.  1.  1.]

Now using the *BFGS* algorithm, using the first derivative and a few
options:

>>> res = minimize(rosen, x0, method='BFGS', jac=rosen_der,
...                options={'gtol': 1e-6, 'disp': True})
Optimization terminated successfully.
         Current function value: 0.000000
         Iterations: 52
         Function evaluations: 64
         Gradient evaluations: 64
>>> res.x
[ 1.  1.  1.  1.  1.]
>>> print res.message
Optimization terminated successfully.
>>> res.hess

Next, consider a minimization problem with several constraints (namely
Example 16.4 from [5]_). The objective function is:

>>> fun = lambda x: (x[0] - 1)**2 + (x[1] - 2.5)**2

There are three constraints defined as:

>>> cons = ({'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x:  x[0] - 2 * x[1] + 2},
...         {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: -x[0] - 2 * x[1] + 6},
...         {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: -x[0] + 2 * x[1] + 2})

And variables must be positive, hence the following bounds:

>>> bnds = ((0, None), (0, None))

The optimization problem is solved using the SLSQP method as:

>>> res = minimize(fun, (2, 0), method='SLSQP', bounds=bnds,
...                constraints=cons)

It should converge to the theoretical solution (1.4 ,1.7).\end{DoxyVerb}

.. versionadded:: 0.11.0

Parameters
----------
fun : callable
    Objective function.
    Scalar function, must return a scalar.
bracket : sequence, optional
    For methods 'brent' and 'golden', `bracket` defines the bracketing
    interval and can either have three items `(a, b, c)` so that `a < b
    < c` and `fun(b) < fun(a), fun(c)` or two items `a` and `c` which
    are assumed to be a starting interval for a downhill bracket search
    (see `bracket`); it doesn't always mean that the obtained solution
    will satisfy `a <= x <= c`.
bounds : sequence, optional
    For method 'bounded', `bounds` is mandatory and must have two items
    corresponding to the optimization bounds.
args : tuple, optional
    Extra arguments passed to the objective function.
method : str or callable, optional
    Type of solver.  Should be one of

        - 'Brent'
        - 'Bounded'
        - 'Golden'
        - custom - a callable object (added in version 0.14.0)
tol : float, optional
    Tolerance for termination. For detailed control, use solver-specific
    options.
options : dict, optional
    A dictionary of solver options.
        maxiter : int
            Maximum number of iterations to perform.
        disp : bool
            Set to True to print convergence messages.

    See :func:`show_options()` for solver-specific options.

Returns
-------
res : OptimizeResult
    The optimization result represented as a ``OptimizeResult`` object.
    Important attributes are: ``x`` the solution array, ``success`` a
    Boolean flag indicating if the optimizer exited successfully and
    ``message`` which describes the cause of the termination. See
    `OptimizeResult` for a description of other attributes.

--------
minimize : Interface to minimization algorithms for scalar multivariate
    functions
show_options : Additional options accepted by the solvers

Notes
-----
This section describes the available solvers that can be selected by the
'method' parameter. The default method is *Brent*.

Method *Brent* uses Brent's algorithm to find a local minimum.
The algorithm uses inverse parabolic interpolation when possible to
speed up convergence of the golden section method.

Method *Golden* uses the golden section search technique. It uses
analog of the bisection method to decrease the bracketed interval. It
is usually preferable to use the *Brent* method.

Method *Bounded* can perform bounded minimization. It uses the Brent
method to find a local minimum in the interval x1 < xopt < x2.

**Custom minimizers**

It may be useful to pass a custom minimization method, for example
when using some library frontend to minimize_scalar.  You can simply
pass a callable as the ``method`` parameter.

The callable is called as ``method(fun, args, **kwargs, **options)``
where ``kwargs`` corresponds to any other parameters passed to `minimize`
(such as `bracket`, `tol`, etc.), except the `options` dict, which has
its contents also passed as `method` parameters pair by pair.  The method
shall return an ``OptimizeResult`` object.

The provided `method` callable must be able to accept (and possibly ignore)
arbitrary parameters; the set of parameters accepted by `minimize` may
expand in future versions and then these parameters will be passed to
the method.  You can find an example in the scipy.optimize tutorial.

Examples
--------
Consider the problem of minimizing the following function.

>>> def f(x):
...     return (x - 2) * x * (x + 2)**2

Using the *Brent* method, we find the local minimum as:

>>> from scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar
>>> res = minimize_scalar(f)
>>> res.x
1.28077640403

Using the *Bounded* method, we find a local minimum with specified
bounds as:

>>> res = minimize_scalar(f, bounds=(-3, -1), method='bounded')
>>> res.x
-2.0000002026\end{DoxyVerb}
