{\bfseries D\+L\+A\+T\+R\+D} reduces the first nb rows and columns of a symmetric/\+Hermitian matrix \hyperlink{classA}{A} to real tridiagonal form by an orthogonal similarity transformation. 

 \begin{DoxyParagraph}{Purpose\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb} DLATRD reduces NB rows and columns of a real symmetric matrix A to
 symmetric tridiagonal form by an orthogonal similarity
 transformation Q**T * A * Q, and returns the matrices V and W which are
 needed to apply the transformation to the unreduced part of A.

 If UPLO = 'U', DLATRD reduces the last NB rows and columns of a
 matrix, of which the upper triangle is supplied;
 if UPLO = 'L', DLATRD reduces the first NB rows and columns of a
 matrix, of which the lower triangle is supplied.

 This is an auxiliary routine called by DSYTRD.\end{DoxyVerb}

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Further Details\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb}  If UPLO = 'U', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
  reflectors

     Q = H(n) H(n-1) . . . H(n-nb+1).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - tau * v * v**T

  where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
  v(i:n) = 0 and v(i-1) = 1; v(1:i-1) is stored on exit in A(1:i-1,i),
  and tau in TAU(i-1).

  If UPLO = 'L', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
  reflectors

     Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(nb).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - tau * v * v**T

  where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
  v(1:i) = 0 and v(i+1) = 1; v(i+1:n) is stored on exit in A(i+1:n,i),
  and tau in TAU(i).

  The elements of the vectors v together form the n-by-nb matrix V
  which is needed, with W, to apply the transformation to the unreduced
  part of the matrix, using a symmetric rank-2k update of the form:
  A := A - V*W**T - W*V**T.

  The contents of A on exit are illustrated by the following examples
  with n = 5 and nb = 2:

  if UPLO = 'U':                       if UPLO = 'L':

    (  a   a   a   v4  v5 )              (  d                  )
    (      a   a   v4  v5 )              (  1   d              )
    (          a   1   v5 )              (  v1  1   a          )
    (              d   1  )              (  v1  v2  a   a      )
    (                  d  )              (  v1  v2  a   a   a  )

  where d denotes a diagonal element of the reduced matrix, a denotes
  an element of the original matrix that is unchanged, and vi denotes
  an element of the vector defining H(i).\end{DoxyVerb}
