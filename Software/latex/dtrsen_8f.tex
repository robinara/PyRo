 \begin{DoxyParagraph}{Purpose\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb} DTRSEN reorders the real Schur factorization of a real matrix
 A = Q*T*Q**T, so that a selected cluster of eigenvalues appears in
 the leading diagonal blocks of the upper quasi-triangular matrix T,
 and the leading columns of Q form an orthonormal basis of the
 corresponding right invariant subspace.

 Optionally the routine computes the reciprocal condition numbers of
 the cluster of eigenvalues and/or the invariant subspace.

 T must be in Schur canonical form (as returned by DHSEQR), that is,
 block upper triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks; each
 2-by-2 diagonal block has its diagonal elements equal and its
 off-diagonal elements of opposite sign.\end{DoxyVerb}

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Further Details\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb}  DTRSEN first collects the selected eigenvalues by computing an
  orthogonal transformation Z to move them to the top left corner of T.
  In other words, the selected eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of T11
  in:

          Z**T * T * Z = ( T11 T12 ) n1
                         (  0  T22 ) n2
                            n1  n2

  where N = n1+n2 and Z**T means the transpose of Z. The first n1 columns
  of Z span the specified invariant subspace of T.

  If T has been obtained from the real Schur factorization of a matrix
  A = Q*T*Q**T, then the reordered real Schur factorization of A is given
  by A = (Q*Z)*(Z**T*T*Z)*(Q*Z)**T, and the first n1 columns of Q*Z span
  the corresponding invariant subspace of A.

  The reciprocal condition number of the average of the eigenvalues of
  T11 may be returned in S. S lies between 0 (very badly conditioned)
  and 1 (very well conditioned). It is computed as follows. First we
  compute R so that

                         P = ( I  R ) n1
                             ( 0  0 ) n2
                               n1 n2

  is the projector on the invariant subspace associated with T11.
  R is the solution of the Sylvester equation:

                        T11*R - R*T22 = T12.

  Let F-norm(M) denote the Frobenius-norm of M and 2-norm(M) denote
  the two-norm of M. Then S is computed as the lower bound

                      (1 + F-norm(R)**2)**(-1/2)

  on the reciprocal of 2-norm(P), the true reciprocal condition number.
  S cannot underestimate 1 / 2-norm(P) by more than a factor of
  sqrt(N).

  An approximate error bound for the computed average of the
  eigenvalues of T11 is

                         EPS * norm(T) / S

  where EPS is the machine precision.

  The reciprocal condition number of the right invariant subspace
  spanned by the first n1 columns of Z (or of Q*Z) is returned in SEP.
  SEP is defined as the separation of T11 and T22:

                     sep( T11, T22 ) = sigma-min( C )

  where sigma-min(C) is the smallest singular value of the
  n1*n2-by-n1*n2 matrix

     C  = kprod( I(n2), T11 ) - kprod( transpose(T22), I(n1) )

  I(m) is an m by m identity matrix, and kprod denotes the Kronecker
  product. We estimate sigma-min(C) by the reciprocal of an estimate of
  the 1-norm of inverse(C). The true reciprocal 1-norm of inverse(C)
  cannot differ from sigma-min(C) by more than a factor of sqrt(n1*n2).

  When SEP is small, small changes in T can cause large changes in
  the invariant subspace. An approximate bound on the maximum angular
  error in the computed right invariant subspace is

                      EPS * norm(T) / SEP\end{DoxyVerb}
