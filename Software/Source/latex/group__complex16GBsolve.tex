{\bfseries  Z\+G\+B\+S\+V\+X computes the solution to system of linear equations \hyperlink{classA}{A} $\ast$ X = B for G\+B matrices} 

 \begin{DoxyParagraph}{Purpose\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb} ZGBSVX uses the LU factorization to compute the solution to a complex
 system of linear equations A * X = B, A**T * X = B, or A**H * X = B,
 where A is a band matrix of order N with KL subdiagonals and KU
 superdiagonals, and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

 Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
 provided.\end{DoxyVerb}
 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Description\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb} The following steps are performed by this subroutine:

 1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
    the system:
       TRANS = 'N':  diag(R)*A*diag(C)     *inv(diag(C))*X = diag(R)*B
       TRANS = 'T': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**T *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
       TRANS = 'C': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**H *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
    Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
    scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
    overwritten by diag(R)*A*diag(C) and B by diag(R)*B (if TRANS='N')
    or diag(C)*B (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C').

 2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor the
    matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
       A = L * U,
    where L is a product of permutation and unit lower triangular
    matrices with KL subdiagonals, and U is upper triangular with
    KL+KU superdiagonals.

 3. If some U(i,i)=0, so that U is exactly singular, then the routine
    returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
    to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
    reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
    INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
    to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.

 4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
    of A.

 5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
    matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
    for it.

 6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
    diag(C) (if TRANS = 'N') or diag(R) (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C') so
    that it solves the original system before equilibration.\end{DoxyVerb}

{\bfseries  Z\+G\+B\+S\+V\+X\+X computes the solution to system of linear equations \hyperlink{classA}{A} $\ast$ X = B for G\+B matrices} 

 \begin{DoxyParagraph}{Purpose\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb}    ZGBSVXX uses the LU factorization to compute the solution to a
    complex*16 system of linear equations  A * X = B,  where A is an
    N-by-N matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

    If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
    are returned. ZGBSVXX will return a solution with a tiny
    guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
    precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
    case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
    calculated and returned.

    ZGBSVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
    factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
    Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
    ZGBSVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
    errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
    user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
    differ from what ZGBSVXX would itself produce.\end{DoxyVerb}
 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Description\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb}    The following steps are performed:

    1. If FACT = 'E', double precision scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
    the system:

      TRANS = 'N':  diag(R)*A*diag(C)     *inv(diag(C))*X = diag(R)*B
      TRANS = 'T': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**T *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
      TRANS = 'C': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**H *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B

    Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
    scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
    overwritten by diag(R)*A*diag(C) and B by diag(R)*B (if TRANS='N')
    or diag(C)*B (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C').

    2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor
    the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as

      A = P * L * U,

    where P is a permutation matrix, L is a unit lower triangular
    matrix, and U is upper triangular.

    3. If some U(i,i)=0, so that U is exactly singular, then the
    routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A
    is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A (see
    argument RCOND). If the reciprocal of the condition number is less
    than machine precision, the routine still goes on to solve for X
    and compute error bounds as described below.

    4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
    of A.

    5. By default (unless PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I) is set to zero),
    the routine will use iterative refinement to try to get a small
    error and error bounds.  Refinement calculates the residual to at
    least twice the working precision.

    6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
    diag(C) (if TRANS = 'N') or diag(R) (if TRANS = 'T' or 'C') so
    that it solves the original system before equilibration.\end{DoxyVerb}
 \begin{DoxyVerb}     Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
     settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
     defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
     can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
     the PARAMS argument.\end{DoxyVerb}

     inv(diag(C))*X if TRANS = 'N' and EQUED = 'C' or 'B', or

\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em R\+C\+O\+N\+D} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
     conditioned.\end{DoxyVerb}

\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em R\+P\+V\+G\+R\+W} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          RPVGRW is DOUBLE PRECISION
     Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
     pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element"
     norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
     the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
     This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
     and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
     0<INFO<=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
     for the leading INFO columns of A.  In DGESVX, this quantity is

     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
             max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
            ------------------------------
                  max_j abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
     returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about

     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:

             max_j ----------------------
                         abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
     information as described below. There currently are up to three
     pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS .LT. 3, then at most
     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:

              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
              current right-hand side and S scales each row of
              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
              sums of Z are approximately 1.
