{\bfseries  S\+P\+O\+S\+V\+X computes the solution to system of linear equations \hyperlink{classA}{A} $\ast$ X = B for P\+O matrices} 

 \begin{DoxyParagraph}{Purpose\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb} SPOSVX uses the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T to
 compute the solution to a real system of linear equations
    A * X = B,
 where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite matrix and X and B
 are N-by-NRHS matrices.

 Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
 provided.\end{DoxyVerb}
 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Description\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb} The following steps are performed:

 1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
    the system:
       diag(S) * A * diag(S) * inv(diag(S)) * X = diag(S) * B
    Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
    scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
    overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

 2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the Cholesky decomposition is used to
    factor the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
       A = U**T* U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
       A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
    where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular
    matrix.

 3. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
    then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
    form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
    A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine
    precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine
    still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as
    described below.

 4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
    of A.

 5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
    matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
    for it.

 6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
    diag(S) so that it solves the original system before
    equilibration.\end{DoxyVerb}

                       been computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                       solution and error bounds are computed because
                       there are a number of situations where the
                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
                       value of RCOND would suggest.\end{DoxyVerb}

{\bfseries  S\+P\+O\+S\+V\+X\+X computes the solution to system of linear equations \hyperlink{classA}{A} $\ast$ X = B for P\+O matrices} 

 \begin{DoxyParagraph}{Purpose\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb}    SPOSVXX uses the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T
    to compute the solution to a real system of linear equations
    A * X = B, where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite matrix
    and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

    If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
    are returned. SPOSVXX will return a solution with a tiny
    guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
    precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
    case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
    calculated and returned.

    SPOSVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
    factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
    Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
    SPOSVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
    errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
    user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
    differ from what SPOSVXX would itself produce.\end{DoxyVerb}
 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Description\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb}    The following steps are performed:

    1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
    the system:

      diag(S)*A*diag(S)     *inv(diag(S))*X = diag(S)*B

    Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
    scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
    overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

    2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the Cholesky decomposition is used to
    factor the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
       A = U**T* U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
       A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
    where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular
    matrix.

    3. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
    then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
    form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
    A (see argument RCOND).  If the reciprocal of the condition number
    is less than machine precision, the routine still goes on to solve
    for X and compute error bounds as described below.

    4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
    of A.

    5. By default (unless PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I) is set to zero),
    the routine will use iterative refinement to try to get a small
    error and error bounds.  Refinement calculates the residual to at
    least twice the working precision.

    6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
    diag(S) so that it solves the original system before
    equilibration.\end{DoxyVerb}
 \begin{DoxyVerb}     Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
     settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
     defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
     can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
     the PARAMS argument.\end{DoxyVerb}

     On entry, the symmetric matrix A, except if FACT = 'F' and EQUED =
     'Y', then A must contain the equilibrated matrix
     diag(S)*A*diag(S).  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N upper
     triangular part of A contains the upper triangular part of the

     the strictly upper triangular part of A is not referenced.  A is
     not modified if FACT = 'F' or 'N', or if FACT = 'E' and EQUED =

     Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
       = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
       = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
               replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
     EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an

\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in,out}  & {\em S} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          S is REAL array, dimension (N)
     The row scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
     the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
     'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
     = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
     element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
     of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
     and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
     rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
     Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
     is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
     that may not be reliable.\end{DoxyVerb}

\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em R\+C\+O\+N\+D} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          RCOND is REAL
     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
     conditioned.\end{DoxyVerb}

\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em R\+P\+V\+G\+R\+W} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          RPVGRW is REAL
     Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
     pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element"
     norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
     the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
     This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
     and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
     0<INFO<=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
     for the leading INFO columns of A.\end{DoxyVerb}

     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:

            ------------------------------
                  max_j abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
     returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:

              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise

              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the

     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS .LT. 3, then at most
     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

         the solution and error bounds could not be computed. RCOND = 0
         is returned.
       = N+J: The solution corresponding to the Jth right-hand side is
         not guaranteed. The solutions corresponding to other right-
         hand sides K with K > J may not be guaranteed as well, but
         only the first such right-hand side is reported. If a small
         componentwise error is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0) then
         the Jth right-hand side is the first with a normwise error
         bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest J such
         that ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0). By default (PARAMS(3) = 1.0)
         the Jth right-hand side is the first with either a normwise or
         componentwise error bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest
         J such that either ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0 or
         ERR_BNDS_COMP(J,1) = 0.0). See the definition of
         ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,1) and ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,1). To get information
         about all of the right-hand sides check ERR_BNDS_NORM or
         ERR_BNDS_COMP.\end{DoxyVerb}
