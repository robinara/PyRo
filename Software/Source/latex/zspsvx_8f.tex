{\bfseries  Z\+S\+P\+S\+V\+X computes the solution to system of linear equations \hyperlink{classA}{A} $\ast$ X = B for O\+T\+H\+E\+R matrices} 

 \begin{DoxyParagraph}{Purpose\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb} ZSPSVX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization A = U*D*U**T or
 A = L*D*L**T to compute the solution to a complex system of linear
 equations A * X = B, where A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix stored
 in packed format and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

 Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
 provided.\end{DoxyVerb}
 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Description\+: }
\begin{DoxyVerb} The following steps are performed:

 1. If FACT = 'N', the diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A as
       A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
       A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
    where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
    triangular matrices and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
    1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

 2. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the routine
    returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A is used
    to estimate the condition number of the matrix A.  If the
    reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine precision,
    INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine still goes on
    to solve for X and compute error bounds as described below.

 3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
    of A.

 4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
    matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
    for it.\end{DoxyVerb}

\hline
\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em R\+C\+O\+N\+D} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
          The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
          A.  If RCOND is less than the machine precision (in
          particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix is singular to working
          precision.  This condition is indicated by a return code of
          INFO > 0.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em F\+E\+R\+R} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          FERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
          The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
          X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
          overestimate of the true error.\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em B\+E\+R\+R} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
          The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
          vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
          any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).\end{DoxyVerb}

\hline
\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em R\+W\+O\+R\+K} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)\end{DoxyVerb}
\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt out}  & {\em I\+N\+F\+O} & \begin{DoxyVerb}          INFO is INTEGER
          = 0: successful exit
          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
                <= N:  D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                       has been completed but the factor D is exactly
                       singular, so the solution and error bounds could
                       not be computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
                = N+1: D is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                       solution and error bounds are computed because
                       there are a number of situations where the
                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
                       value of RCOND would suggest.\end{DoxyVerb}
